	<p>RSA is a method of public key cryptography first devloped in 1977, and is used to send messages securely across the internet by encryption. The basic principle of RSA relies heavily on the difficult in factorising an extremely large semi-prime number back into its two prime factors. Through the use of private and public keys, RSA allows a user to create a large prime privately using two unique prime numbers, encrypt the message using the public key, derived from the large product, and send it to a friend, who can then use the private key to decrypt the message. Without the knowledge of the private key or the primes, no one can decode the message</p>
