	<p>Officially developed in 1977 by Ron <b>R</b>ivest, Adi <b>S</b>hamir and Leonard <b>A</b>dleman, it was an unintentional generalization of the methods created by Clifford Cocks in 1973 (as at the time they were completely unknown)</p>

<h3 id="theMen">The Men Behind the Algorithm</h3> 

<p>Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman were working for MIT in the 1970’s and began working on a way of encrypting messages asymmetrically, using the products of two large prime numbers. By 1977, they were able to publicly describe the algorithm and began making it a working example. </p>

<h3 id="theBackstory">Who can claim they 'invented' RSA?</h3>

<p>Although Ron, Adir and Leonard officially gained the US patent for RSA in 1983, it was thought that they were the original founders of the method. However, documents released in 1998 show Clifford Cocks had developed a very similar system for GCHQ way back in 1973. However, as this was kept top-secret until well past RSA’s conception, Cocks’ work was not credited and he was never hailed as the creator of the algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="moreInfo">From then to now</h3>

<p>The US patent for RSA would have expired in September 2000, had it not been for the public release of the algorithm by ‘RSA Security’ two weeks earlier to this. Consequentially, anyone can now create an RSA encryption of their own, however it is the huge complex primes that create the most valuable encryptions, as they are hardest to crack.</p>
