	<p>Algorithms are a list of instructions, which take us from one place, value or state, and take us to another. When talking about cryptography, algorithms are individual or combinations of mathematical functions designed specifically to encode data.</p>

<p>Algorithms are a set of well defined, clear instructions, whether mathematics or procedures, designed to allow the user to fulfil a certain task. Whether this is data processing, encryption or a simple maths problem, algorithms are always a strict set of rules which must be followed exactly to complete the task. They can contain loops and 'if statements' which only execute under certain conditions, however all algorithms have a final goal which you are trying to reach.</p>

  <p>An animation showing the 'depth first search' algorithm in action. This runs through a tree by exploring all child nodes first, this is shown by the order in which the animation locations each node.
