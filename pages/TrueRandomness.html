	<p>Many implementations of public key cryptography depend on randomly generated numbers to ensure their security. This poses the problem that given an attacker can predict the random numbers generated, the security of the system is comprimised.</p>

  	<p>Truly random values take into account all sorts of data to make it as hard as possible for an attacker to influence the number generated in a predictable manner.</p>

<p>
	In public key cryptography, a random number generator is used to pick a key. If the random number is predictable, it can become easy to recreate the steps made during initial key generation and computate the private key.

<h2>random.org</h2>
<p>random.org run a service generating random numbers for anyone who needs them. The numbers are generated from atmospheric noise and so are difficult/near to impossible for an attacker to interfere with it.</p>

<h2>Application in RSA encryption</h2>
<p>In RSA encryption, the public and private keys should be chosen with adequete entropy, and with a seed length of twice the intended security level (see: <a href="#" class="link">Key Size</a>)
